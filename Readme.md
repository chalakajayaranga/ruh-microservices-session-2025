# RUH Microservices Session 2025

This repository contains two microservices: `invoicing-service` and `payment-service`. These services communicate with each other using RabbitMQ for message passing.

## Running the Services

### Prerequisites

- Docker (https://www.docker.com/get-started/)
- Docker Compose

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/ChalakaKasthuriArachchi/ruh-microservices-session-2025
   cd RUH-MICROSERVICES-SESSION-2025

2. Build & run the services using Docker Compose
    If you 
    ```
    docker compose up --build -d

3. Access the Invoice service using Rest API
    ```
    http://localhost:8080

5. Access swagger API documentation
    ```
    http://localhost:8080/swagger

4. Stop all services
    ```
    docker compose down

## Appendix

### Some importat docker commands which are going to be used in the demostration

- View running docker containers : `docker ps`
- View all docker containers : `docker ps -a`
- View logs of a docker container : `docker logs <container_id/container_name>`
- Follow the last 50 lines of the logs of a docker container : `docker --tail -f 50 -a <container_id/container_name>`
- Stop a docker container : `docker stop <container_id/container_name>`
- Start a docker container : `docker start <container_id/container_name>`
